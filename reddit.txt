Title: Interactive Geo TB upgrade + Republic Offensive

Hi all,
Seen as the original interactive geonosis tb map author (https://www.reddit.com/r/SWGalaxyOfHeroes/comments/cv9m0h/interactive_geonosis_tb_map/ ) has stated they do not have the time to actively work on the project anymore, myself and a friend have decided to implement some updates to the project which we would like to share. (We contacted the original author before sharing this!)

The up-to-date version can now be found at: https://genskaar.github.io/tb_geo/

Here are some of the changes/new features

*New Republic Offensive Interactive Map
*Redesigned Platoons to show how many of each toon is needed for full completion
*Added some youtube links for popular walkthroughs/guides
*Added GP and unit requirements to the missions that have them
*Added "Suggest a squad button to suggest squads that work well for completing waves"
*Restructured site for access to both LS and DS interactive TB (desktop view strongly reccomended)
*Added a table of guild deployment strats to help you get the most stars for your GP
*Added a credits page with credits for sources and the original ds author (Who we contacted and gave us permission to publish)
*Added icons for KAM and WT Missions


There are still some things which could be added and if you want to help with the project:
*Consider adding your guild's strategy to the guild deployment strats page.
*Consider suggesting a squad for a specific mission on the squad suggestion page. For LS in particular there a lot of later phase missions without a recommended squad at present.
*Contribute to the project's development @ https://github.com/genskaar/tb_geo

Also if you have any suggestions for improvements, please let me know. Whilst I have a lot of programming experience, I have never done any webdesign so any advice/suggestions would be much appreciated.
